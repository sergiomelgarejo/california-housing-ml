I chose the California Housing Prices dataset from Kaggle.
This dataset was based on data from the [1990 California Census](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices),

### The main goal
The purpose of the project is to predict median house values in Californian districts 
given some features from these districts.
This dataset has metrics such as the population, median income, median housing price, 
and so on for each block group in California.

### Some steps to perform

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical data
- Standardize data
- Performing data exploratory analysis
- Visualize the relationship between features and target
- Making insights
- Training as many ML algorithms as possible such as: Linear Regression, 
Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and more.
- Compare the model's performance with Real State experts.


### Setup

Install all the dependencies:

`pip install requirements.txt`
